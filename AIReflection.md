# AI Usage and Reflection

## 1. How did you use AI in this assignment?

I used AI as a learning and support tool while working on this assignment. AI helped me understand concepts, debug errors, and explore better ways to structure my code. Instead of giving me final answers to copy, AI provided explanations, examples, and suggestions that helped me think through problems on my own.

I also used AI to clarify instructions, understand Android development concepts, and improve my code readability. This allowed me to move forward when I was stuck and helped reinforce what I was learning during development.

## 2. What did you learn from using AI?

Using AI helped me learn how to approach problems step by step instead of feeling overwhelmed. I learned how to read error messages more carefully, how different parts of the app connect together, and how to apply best practices in Android development.

AI also helped me understand *why* something works, not just *how* to make it work. This made it easier to remember concepts and apply them later without relying on AI every time.

## 3. How did AI support your learning rather than replace it?

AI supported my learning by acting like a guide or tutor instead of doing the work for me. I still had to write the code, test it, fix mistakes, and make decisions. AI helped explain concepts, suggest improvements, and point out possible issues, but the final implementation and understanding came from my own effort.

This approach helped me build confidence and problem-solving skills, which are important for future assignments and real-world development work.
